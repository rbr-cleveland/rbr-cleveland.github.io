  heading: Why Compost?
  text: >
    The United States EPA estimates that as much as 24% of all household
    waste is compostable. When food scraps are sent to landfills their
    decomposition process produces methane, a greenhouse gas twenty times
    more damaging to the o-zone than carbon dioxide. By diverting these food
    scraps away from land fills and into nutrient rich soil amendments - we
    can help restore soil health, advance the work of local food production,
    and reduce our ecological footprints.

    Rust Belt Riders Composting believes in the value of workers across
    all sectors and our respect for work manifests itself in the belief that
    all employees ought to share in the success of the company. For us, this
    takes shape in the form of worker-ownership. All employees are co-owners,
    making decisions with one another to best meet the needs of our employees,
    the community, and the planet.
